# Introduction

Nioxis is my Neovim configuration for Linux, macOS and Windows based on ['kickstart'](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). The main motivation for creating yet-another-nvim-config, is to alleviate some of the hassles I faced trying to configure Neovim for two specific purposes : Game Development in Godot and Embedded Technologies/Microcontrollers.

The heart of this config is the `init.lua` file in the root directory. Since this a heavily modified version of kickstart, I intentionally left some of the comments already there and added some of my own to further refine this particular repo, however, I strongly suggest reading the kickstart documentation or using the `:help` command if you find yourself in trouble.

# Installation

## Pre-requisites

### Terminal emulators

The [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) we choose is a big part of the appearance and features of Neovim. Most of the themes and plugins included in this config, take advantage of terminal emulators that use true colors. For a list of terminal emulators that support true colors, please see [here](https://github.com/termstandard/colors?tab=readme-ov-file#terminal-emulators).

Since I work mostly on macOS, I can recommend checking out [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) or my favorite and personal choice [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html). Wezterm uses Lua for its config file that I will also include in this repo.

In order to make the terminal a lot prettier, I recommend installing [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). There are a lot of [themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) to choose from, but the examples I'll provide in this README will showcase [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

### Installing Neovim

This config and the plugins I use, will require the latest stable version of Neovim, please check the official installation section [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim?tab=readme-ov-file#install-from-package).

<details><summary>Windows with gcc/make using chocolatey</summary>

The easiest way to install Neovim and its basic dependencies is using choco.

1. Install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)
   either follow the instructions on the page or use winget,
   run in cmd as **admin**:

```bash
winget install --accept-source-agreements chocolatey.chocolatey
```

2. Install all requirements using choco, exit previous cmd and
   open a new one so that choco path is set, and run in cmd as **admin**:

```bash
choco install -y neovim git ripgrep wget fd unzip gzip mingw make
```

</details>

<details><summary>macOS</summary>

You can install Neovim on macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

1. Install brew either by downloading the pkg from the main page or using this command on the terminal:

```sh
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Run the command to install Neovim.

```sh
brew install neovim
```

</details>

<details><summary>Ubuntu</summary>

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/unstable -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make gcc ripgrep unzip git xclip neovim
```

</details>

<details><summary>Arch Install Steps</summary>

```sh
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed gcc make git ripgrep fd unzip neovim
```

</details>

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:

- If you followed the previous steps chances are, you already have most of this utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`).
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation).
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).
- A great majority of plugins are written in Python. You can install it through the [official page](https://www.python.org/) or using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides icons that some plugins use. If you installed Oh My Zsh, it comes by default with MesloLGS.
  - `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` is set to `true` by default, change it to `false` should you don't feel like using a Nerd Font.
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit).
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Whatever method you choose to install any dependency (ej. python, npm, nvim) make sure you add the installation directory to you PATH. You can do this by adding the following line at the end of your `.bash_profile`or `.zshrc` file, usually located in your HOME directory:
>
> ```sh
>  export PATH="/your/dependency/directory/:$PATH"
> ```
>
> This will ensure that your terminal can see it. Most package managers already do this, but is a common gotcha if you are not experienced with the terminal.
